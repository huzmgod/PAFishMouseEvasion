**PAFish Mouse Evasion**

PAFish is a vm detection tool which runs some tests to identify if the environment is a virtual machine or not.
This code is designed to pass the mouse existence/movement testcases automatically without having to use a mouse.
To use it make sure to have the python library pyautogui installed!:
